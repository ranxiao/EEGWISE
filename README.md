Use DataPreparation_Biosemi.m to prepare EEG data by selecting different task conditions and collating them together.
This function is specific to the reach study. For other studies, please prepare data in EEGLAB .set format, which is currently adopted in EEGWISE.
Other formats, such as BIDS, are in development.

Right click and run 'DataPreparation_Biosemi.m' to start the EEGWISE GUI interface and batch process EEG data.
