% Specify the paths to the different relevant folders

% Folder where EEGLAB is:
Path2EEGLAB = 'C:\Users\anafl\Documents\MATLAB\eeglab2022.1';
% Folder where the function for APICE are:

% Folder where the data is:

% File with the hannels layout

%% ADD TOOLBOXES AND PATHS TO USEFUL FOLDERS
%
% Add to the path the required toolboxes
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Add EEGLAB to the path
cd(Path2EEGLAB)

close all

% Add the functions for APICE (https://github.com/neurokidslab/eeg_preprocessing)
addpath(genpath(Path2APICE))

% Add the path to the folder with the parameters
addpath(Path2Parameters)

% Got to the path where the main scripts are
cd(Path0)
